            <p><em><ins>A plate is a flat, usually round dish used for serving and eating food, often having a slightly raised edge. It's a common tableware item, particularly in Western culture, and is suitable for foods that don't require a lot of liquid. Plates can be made from various materials like ceramic, glass, metal, or plastic. </ins></p>
